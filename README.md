# 20 React: React Portfolio

## The Introduction: 

Hello! My name is Brittany Jungclaus and this is my portfolio. 

This portfolio application has been meticulously crafted and designed to serve as a comprehensive showcase of my projects, resume, and skills. With catering specifically to potential employers, clients, and individuals with a keen interest in exploring my body of work. 

Leveraging the power of React, an open-source JavaScript library renowned for its ability to construct seamless user interfaces, this application seamlessly operates as a one-page interface, intricately simulating the immersive experience of navigating through multiple pages.

* Notice: This is all Client-End in its current state, and will be updated accordingly to be able to handle form submissions and resume downloads very soon!
